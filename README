Record
------

The arecord and aplay alsa utilities are actually one and the same program, so
it was stripped down, all signals removed, all playback removed, all header
files merged into it, then a "capture_stop" global variable was added, which if
set to 1, the main audio capture loop will end. Then it is called from cython
using nogil in it's own thread and when the user wants to end it, the
"capture_stop" is set to 1. 

It was then stripped down even more extremely for use as an embedded streamer.

Usage
-----
